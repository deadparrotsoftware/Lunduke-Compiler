Lunduke-Compiler
================

A compiler for a made up dialect of the Lunduke Language (And you though lisp dialects were weird :P) 

The Lunduke-SDK has never been released and I've always been interested in the compiler but it's never been released so I'm going to write my own.

Grammar is mostly guess work based off a screen shot of LDE and unfortunately doesn't draw on the wiki which seems to be missing(if anyone has that description please let me know).

### Plan :

* Create Grammar (done)

* Removed Left Recursion from the Grammar

* Left Factor the Grammar

* Write a Parser

* Write a compiler based on the parse tree

Probably going to do the first 3 by hand and the last 2 either by using a framework like Javacc(since I've used it before) or in Ruby/Node.

Hope to have a working parser within the week.
